"""
Bob has traveled a lot and has a lot of currency types. 
He needs a machine that will get currency and convert it into dollars.
The machine already gets the money and can categorize it onto type and amount. 
it also has the current conversion rates. The only thing it needs is a way to calculate all of it into dollars.
Method arguments:
-money (String[][]): 
a 2d array of strings, each row gets two places, one for currency type second for the amount:
[
["euro","1.5"],
["yen","21.5"],
["mark","100.0"]
]
the amount value is a string you will have to convert it to double to use it for calculations.
-convertionRate (String[][]):
another 2d array of strings, first place in each row holds the currency name 
second is the conversion rate to dollars for example:
[
["euro","0.003"],
["yen","0.5"],
["mark","0.87"]
]
return:
the sum of all currencies in dollars as a double.
You need to write code to read how much of given currency Bob has and check USD conversion rate 
for that currency in the second array then multiple them to get how much USD he will end up with total.
for example:
convertC([["drachma","11.0"],["sek","5.0"]] , [["drachma","0.6"],["sek","100"]]);
returns: 506.6
(Bob has 11.0 drachma and 5.0 Sek currency money and he needs to convert them to USD. 
Conversion rates are in second array. So we multiple (11.0 * 0.6) +(5.0 * 100) and return the result )
convertC([["yen","5.0"],["frank","5.0"]] , [["yen","1"],["frank","1"]]);
returns: 10

def convertC(currency, amount):
    for each in amount:
        if each in currency:
            print("\n" , each, ":", amount[each] * currency[each])

#  MAIN
            
currency = {"Euro" : 7, "Dollar" : 6, "Gold" : 350}
amount = {"Euro" : 1000, "Dollar" : 1000, "Gold" : 10}
print("\nCurrency : ", currency)
print("\nAmount    : ", amount)
convertC(currency, amount)
